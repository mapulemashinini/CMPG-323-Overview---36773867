# Branch strategy

The branch strategy that will be used in each project is the GitHub Flow Branching Strategy which will create different segments for each different type of work to be done, namely:

* Main Branch - long running branch 
* Feature Branch - short running branch
* Test Branch

This will ensure that I have a healthy commit history and better version control of my projects. This prevents adding unwanted and untested code from being placed in the production environment.  Since I am a single team member on the projects, it allows for the project to run on a simple and lean structure.
