# Branch strategy

The branch strategy that will be used in each project is the GitHub Flow Branching Strategy which will create different segments for each different type of work to be done, namely:

* Main Branch - long running branch 
* Feature Branch - short running branch
* Test Branch

This will ensure that I have a healthy commit history and better version control of my projects. This prevents adding unwanted and untested code from being placed in the production environment.  Since I am a single team member on the projects, it allows for the project to run on a simple and lean structure.


# Use of .gitignore file

I will be using the .gitignore file to ignore:

* log files
* Files with API keys/secrets, credentials, or sensitive information
*  Ignore Visual Studio temporary files, build results, and files generated by popular Visual Studio add-ons. (source: Storage of credentials and sensitive informationhttps://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/visualstudio)
